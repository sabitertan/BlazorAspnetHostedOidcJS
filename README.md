# BlazorAspnetHostedOidcJS
## Blazor Asp.Net Hosted using oidc-client.js with JSInterop
This project aimed to use OpenID Connect Javascript client in any Blazor flavor(Wasm, Server Side, ASP.NET Hosted).
Project has browser feature detect to switch between Wasm and Server side rendering dynamically.
Client side also can run independently.
